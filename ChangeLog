	* graph/gog-control-foocanvas.c (gog_control_foocanvas_draw) : big

	* graph/gog-plot.c (gog_plot_request_cardinality_update) : we may add
	  a series before assigning to a chart.

	* graph/gog-theme.c (gog_themes_init) : default and guppi themes were
	  inverted for legends.

	* graph/gog-view.c (gog_view_invalidate_sizes) : new.

	* graph/gog-legend.c (gog_legend_view_render) : typo.  pad is in Y
	  coordinates.

	* graph/gog-plot.c (role_series_post_add) : adding a series changes
	  the cardinality.
	(role_series_pre_remove) : ditto.
	(gog_plot_update) : delete.  Already handled at the chart level.
	(gog_plot_init) : Make sure cardinailty is initially valid so that we
	  queue an an update request as necessary when it really
	  does change.

	* graph/gog-chart.c (gog_chart_view_size_allocate) : support the
	  alignment flags and enforce clipping.
	(role_plot_post_add) : adding a plot changes the cardinality.
	(role_plot_pre_remove) : ditto.
	(gog_chart_init) : Make sure cardinailty is initially valid so that we

	* graph/gog-renderer.c (gog_renderer_outline_size) : keep widths >= 1

	* graph/plugins/plot_barcol/gog-barcol.c (barcol_draw_rect) : clip to
	  integer sizes to decrease amount of bleed through due to antialiasing.

2003-05-27  Jody Goldberg <jody@gnome.org>

	* graph/gog-legend.c : make the swatch sizes properties.

	* graph/gog-guru.c (cb_typesel_sample_plot_resize) : fix sizing.

	  set the values if they are _different_ not the same.

2003-05-26  Jody Goldberg <jody@gnome.org>

	* graph/gog-guru.c (graph_guru_set_page) : we can't run the
	  typeselector without a chart selected.
	(cb_graph_guru_add_plot) : the child_added handler already populates
	  things.
	(cb_find_child_added) : It may happen that something else will add an
	  item while we're editing, and the change of focus may not be
	  welcome,  However, it is far more likely that we just added it.

	* graph/gog-object.c (gog_object_is_deletable) : don't let the guru
	  delete the top level graph.

	* graph/gog-guru.glade : Add border to the menu bar to align it with
	  the scrolled window.
	Add a 'Precedence' menu.
