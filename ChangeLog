	* graph/gog-guru.c (graph_guru_set_page) : we can't run the
	  typeselector without a chart selected.
	(cb_graph_guru_add_plot) : the child_added handler already populates
	  things.
	(cb_find_child_added) : It may happen that something else will add an
	  item while we're editing, and the change of focus may not be
	  welcome,  However, it is far more likely that we just added it.

	* graph/gog-object.c (gog_object_is_deletable) : don't let the guru
	  delete the top level graph.

	* graph/gog-guru.glade : Add border to the menu bar to align it with
	  the scrolled window.
	Add a 'Precedence' menu.
