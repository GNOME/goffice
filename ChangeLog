	  too if there is no parent.

2003-06-06  Jody Goldberg <jody@gnome.org>

	* graph/gog-chart.c (gog_chart_set_position) : simplify.
	* graph/gog-graph.c (gog_graph_validate_chart_layout) : new.

	(cb_sample_released) : and unset it here so that the icons don't get
	  shrunk.

2003-06-04  J.H.M. Dassen (Ray) <jdassen@debian.org>

	* graph/gog-style.h: Fixed include of command-context.h to make it work
	for builds outside the source dir.

2003-06-04  Jody Goldberg <jody@gnome.org>

	* graph/gog-object.c (gog_object_generate_name) : return NULL, not FALSE

2003-06-02  Jody Goldberg <jody@gnome.org>

	* graph/gog-legend.c (cb_render_elements) : quick and dirty draw the
	  text.  Still lots of work needed to measure things properly and do a
	  more dynamic layout.

	* graph/gog-guru.c (cb_typesel_sample_plot_resize) : use the canvas zoom
	(cb_sample_plot_resize) : ditto.
	(graph_guru_init_format_page) : ditto.
	(graph_guru_type_selector_new) : ditto.

	* graph/gog-renderer-pixbuf.c (make_layout) : new.
	(gog_renderer_pixbuf_draw_text) : new. simple handler no rotation yet.
	(gog_renderer_pixbuf_measure_text) : new.
	(gog_art_renderer_new) : new utility.
	(gog_renderer_pixbuf_draw_polygon) : used here.

	* graph/gog-control-foocanvas.c (gog_control_foocanvas_draw) : another
	  speed up by using regions rather tha nthe bounding rect of the expose.
	  Thanks to AlexL for pointing out that this will help us when
	  multiple exposes are compressed into 1 event and we do better to
	  clip against the distinct sub regions, than the bounding box of all
	  of them.
	(gog_control_foocanvas_update) : make life easier and pass the zoom to
	  the renderer.

2003-06-02  Jody Goldberg <jody@gnome.org>

	* graph/gog-style.c : minor warning suppression and format style
	  tidying.

2003-06-01  Jean Brefort <jean.brefort@ac-dijon.fr>
	* graph/gog-style.h : new gradient styles,
		fill type accessible only if GOG_STYLE_FILL is used
	* graph/gog-style.c : Enhanced gradient selector
	* graph/gog-renderer-pixbuf.c : Support for new gradient types
	* graph/gog-themes.c : Top to bottom gradient in Guppi theme

	  canvas warnings about tryingto queue an update from an update
	  handler.

2003-05-30  Jody Goldberg <jody@gnome.org>

	* graph/gog-theme.c (gog_themes_init) : make default them fill legend
	  with white.

	* graph/plugins/plot_barcol/gog-barcol.c (barcol_draw_rect) : smooth
	  the anti-aliasing fuzziness in the libart backend for hairline
	  outlines.

	* graph/gog-chart.c (gog_chart_view_size_allocate) : support
	  positions of NE, NW, SE, SW so that we can handle XL's 'corner'
	  legends.

	* graph/gog-control-foocanvas.c (gog_control_foocanvas_draw) : big
	  speed win.  Only draw the piece of the chart that was exposed.

	* graph/gog-plot.c (gog_plot_request_cardinality_update) : we may add
	  a series before assigning to a chart.

	* graph/gog-theme.c (gog_themes_init) : default and guppi themes were
	  inverted for legends.

	* graph/gog-view.c (gog_view_invalidate_sizes) : new.

	* graph/gog-legend.c (gog_legend_view_render) : typo.  pad is in Y
	  coordinates.

	* graph/gog-plot.c (role_series_post_add) : adding a series changes
	  the cardinality.
	(role_series_pre_remove) : ditto.
	(gog_plot_update) : delete.  Already handled at the chart level.
	(gog_plot_init) : Make sure cardinailty is initially valid so that we
	  queue an an update request as necessary when it really
	  does change.

	* graph/gog-chart.c (gog_chart_view_size_allocate) : support the
	  alignment flags and enforce clipping.
	(role_plot_post_add) : adding a plot changes the cardinality.
	(role_plot_pre_remove) : ditto.

	* graph/gog-guru.c (graph_guru_set_page) : we can't run the
	  typeselector without a chart selected.
	(cb_graph_guru_add_plot) : the child_added handler already populates
	  things.
	(cb_find_child_added) : It may happen that something else will add an
	  item while we're editing, and the change of focus may not be
	  welcome,  However, it is far more likely that we just added it.

	* graph/gog-object.c (gog_object_is_deletable) : don't let the guru
	  delete the top level graph.

	* graph/gog-guru.glade : Add border to the menu bar to align it with
